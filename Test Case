 Features:
 - Option to store last known calculated value after each calculation. 
 – Recall last known calculated value. 
 – Square Root function 
 – Trigonometry functions for cosine, sine and tangent 
 – Exponential of A to B
 – All functions should either calculate based on inputs or from stored last known values.
